## Tonkotsu Broth: The Foundation

This is the star of the show – a deeply flavorful, emulsified pork broth. Patience is key!

### Ingredients:

*   **2 lbs** Pork neck bones
*   **2 lbs** Pork femurs, split lengthwise to expose marrow
    *   *Optional Twist:* For deeper color and flavor, roast 1-2 lbs of the bones instead of blanching them (skip steps 2-4 for the roasted bones).
*   **0.4 lbs** Pork fatback
*   *Optional Aromatics:*
    *   **½** Onion, halved or quartered
    *   **6** Garlic cloves, smashed

### Steps:

1.  **Soak (Optional but Recommended):** The night before, or at least 6 hours prior, soak neck bones and femurs in cold water in a large, non-reactive container. This helps achieve a whiter final broth. Store in the fridge.
2.  **Blanch - Part 1:** Drain the soaking water. Place the bones in a large stockpot and cover with fresh cold water. Bring to a rolling boil, then immediately reduce heat to a steady simmer.
3.  **Blanch - Part 2 (Skimming):** Skim the grey/brown scum that rises to the surface. Continue simmering and skimming for 15-20 minutes. The scum will change consistency; keep skimming until very little new scum appears. *Don't skip or rush this step – it's crucial for a clean, white broth.*
4.  **Clean:** Carefully strain the bones, discarding the murky blanching liquid. Rinse the bones thoroughly under cold running water, scrubbing away any dark bits, blood, or impurities lodged in crevices. Clean the pot as well.
5.  **Pressure Cook - Round 1:** Return the cleaned bones to the pot (or a clean pressure cooker). Add fresh water *just enough to cover the bones*. Secure the lid, bring to a boil, then bring to full pressure (**15 PSI**). Cook under pressure for **2 hours**.
6.  **Pressure Cook - Round 2:** Carefully perform a fast release (or normal release if your cooker requires it). Stir the contents. Secure the lid again, bring back to full pressure (**15 PSI**), and cook for another **1 hour**.
7.  **Pressure Cook - Round 3 (Fatback):** Depressurize the cooker. Add the **pork fatback** to the pot and stir it in. Secure the lid, bring back to full pressure (**15 PSI**), and cook for a final **1 hour**.
8.  **Emulsify Fat:** Depressurize carefully. Remove the softened fatback pieces and transfer them to a blender. Add a ladle or two of the hot broth. Blend until the fatback is *completely* liquefied into a smooth, milky liquid. Pour this emulsion back into the main broth pot and stir well. *Ensure no chunks remain.*
9.  **Add Aromatics (Optional):** If using, add the onion and garlic to the pot now.
10. **Reduce & Finish:** Cook the broth **uncovered** at a **strong, rolling boil** for 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, or until it becomes opaque, creamy, and reaches your desired consistency. Stir frequently, especially towards the end, scraping the bottom to prevent scorching.
11. **Strain & Store:** Strain the finished broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the solids. Use immediately, store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or freeze in portions for several months.

## Quick Shoyu Tare

This is a simple soy sauce-based seasoning liquid (tare) added to the bowl before the broth.

> *Author's Note: I eyeballed this version. It worked, but feel free to adjust or use a more traditional recipe.*

### Ingredients:

*   **100 g** Water
*   **150 g** Soy sauce (using mostly *Usukuchi* - light soy sauce - helps maintain the broth's lighter color)
*   **10 g** Small dried sardines (*Niboshi*)
*   **20 g** Brown sugar
*   **40 g** Salt
*   **5 g** MSG (*highly recommended for authentic Tonkotsu flavor*)

### Steps:

1.  Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan.
2.  Bring to a simmer, stirring until the salt and sugar are fully dissolved.
3.  Remove from heat, allow to cool completely, then strain out the niboshi. Store refrigerated.

## Garlic Aroma Oil

A finishing touch that adds a fragrant garlic dimension.

### Ingredients:

*   **½ cup** Lard (or neutral oil like canola/vegetable)
*   **12** Garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed

### Steps:

1.  Combine lard and garlic cloves in a small saucepan.
2.  Cook over **medium-low heat**, stirring occasionally.
3.  Continue cooking until the garlic turns golden brown and toasty, about 15-30 minutes (watch carefully to avoid burning).
4.  Remove from heat and let cool completely in the pan.
5.  Strain the oil, discarding the garlic (or save it for another use). Store the garlic oil in an airtight container in the fridge (lard-based will solidify).

## Sous Vide Pork Belly Chashu

Tender, flavorful pork belly topping with a pleasant texture – not too soft, not too chewy.

### Ingredients:

*   **1 slab** Pork belly (about 1-2 lbs, depending on preference)
*   **½ cup** Mirin
*   **½ cup** Soy sauce
*   **1 cup** Water
*   **1 tbsp** Brown sugar
*   **¼ cup** Sake

### Steps:

1.  **Preheat Water Bath:** Set your sous vide circulator to **174°F (79°C)**.
2.  **Sear Pork:** Pat the pork belly dry. Sear all sides in a hot pan until deeply golden brown and nicely rendered. Set aside.
3.  **Make Braising Liquid:** Pour off excess fat from the pan. Deglaze the pan by adding the mirin, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and sake. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer for a minute or two.
4.  **Cool Liquid:** Remove the liquid from the heat and let it cool down significantly (lukewarm or cooler is best).
5.  **Bag Pork:** Place the seared pork belly into a sous vide bag. Pour the cooled braising liquid into the bag.
6.  **Seal & Cook:** Remove air from the bag using the water displacement method (submerge the bag in water, letting the pressure push air out the top before sealing) or a vacuum sealer. Clamp the bag to the side of your water bath container if needed.
7.  **Sous Vide:** Cook the pork belly in the water bath for **7 to 12 hours**. (7 hours yields a slightly firmer bite, 12 hours is more tender).
8.  **Chill:** Once cooked, immediately transfer the bag to an ice water bath to chill rapidly. This helps it firm up for easier slicing.
9.  **Store & Slice:** Store the chilled chashu in its bag in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, remove from the bag (you can reserve the liquid for other uses), slice thinly, and gently reheat (e.g., pan-fry, torch, or warm in the ramen broth).
