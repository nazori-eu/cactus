2. Remove the kombu, add **bonito flakes**, and simmer for **5 minutes**.  
3. Strain the dashi to remove the flakes. Set aside.

### 2. Build the Broth:
1. Return the dashi to the pot. Add **chicken thighs**, **onion**, **garlic**, and **ginger**.  
2. Simmer gently for **1–2 hours**, skimming off any impurities.  
3. Optional: Add **chicken wings/carcass** at the start for added depth.

### 3. Add Seasonings:
1. Remove the chicken thighs, shred the meat, and set aside.  
2. Stir in:  
   - **2 tbsp soy sauce**  
   - **1 tbsp sake**  
   - **1 tbsp mirin**  
3. Add **1/4 tsp MSG** for umami. Taste and adjust if needed.

### 4. Thicken the Broth:

2. Optional: Simmer for an additional **5–10 minutes** to meld flavors.

### 5. Cook Noodles and Assemble:
1. Cook ramen noodles according to package instructions.  
2. Divide noodles into two bowls. Pour the **hot creamy broth** over them.  
3. Top with:  
   - Shredded chicken (Semamo oil on the pan)
   - Soft-boiled egg  
   - Green onions  
   - Nori

## Final Tips
- Blend solids (onion, garlic, chicken) for a rich, creamy texture.  
- Adjust with water if too salty, or add soy sauce/MSG for more flavor.  
- Let the broth rest for **30 minutes** for extra depth before reheating and serving.
