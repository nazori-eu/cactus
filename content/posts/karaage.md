Recreate the popular karaage on a stick found in Japanese convenience stores like 7-Eleven.

## Ingredients:
- 500g boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sake
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon MSG (optional, for extra umami)
- ½ cup potato starch or cornstarch
- Oil for deep frying
- Skewers

## Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, combine soy sauce, sake, grated ginger, minced garlic, sugar, and MSG.
   - Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they're well-coated.
   - Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

2. **Prepare for Frying:**
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels.
   - Dredge each piece in potato starch or cornstarch, shaking off excess.

3. **Fry the Chicken:**
   - Heat oil in a deep pan to 160°C (320°F).
   - Fry the chicken pieces in batches for about 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.
   - Increase oil temperature to 180°C (356°F) and fry again for 1-2 minutes until crispy and golden brown.
   - Drain on paper towels.

4. **Assemble the Skewers:**
   - Once slightly cooled, thread the fried chicken pieces onto skewers.
