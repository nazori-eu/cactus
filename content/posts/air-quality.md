### **Important Air Pollutants**

1. **PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)**  
   - Extremely small particles (less than 2.5 micrometers) that penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream.  
   - **Sources**: Traffic emissions, industrial activities, wildfires.  
   - **Why It Matters**: PM2.5 is closely linked to long-term health risks and reduced air quality in urban areas.

2. **PM10 (Coarse Particulate Matter)**  
   - Larger particles (up to 10 micrometers) that can be inhaled into the respiratory system.  
   - **Sources**: Road dust, construction activities, natural dust from deserts.  
   - **Why It Matters**: PM10 contributes to respiratory issues and environmental degradation.

3. **NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)**  
   - A gas primarily produced by burning fossil fuels, especially from vehicles and power plants.  
   - **Sources**: Road traffic, industrial emissions.  
   - **Why It Matters**: NO2 is a key contributor to smog and acid rain, impacting human health and ecosystems.

4. **O3 (Ground-Level Ozone)**  
   - A secondary pollutant formed by chemical reactions between NOx and VOCs in sunlight.  
   - **Sources**: Vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and chemical solvents.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Ground-level ozone affects air quality and is particularly harmful during heatwaves.
